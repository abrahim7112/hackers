Injection flaws occur when untrusted user data are sent to the web application as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the web application into executing unintended commands or accessing unauthorized data. Injection occurs when a hacker feeds malicious, input into the web application that is then acted on (processed) in an unsafe manner.
